      summary: Create Auto Authorization (Part 107)
      description: >-
        Call this method to store a Part 107 Auto Authorization. Input must be a
        valid GeoJSON Feature Collection and, once validation is passed, a Part
        107 Auto Authorization will be stored.


        Acceptable GeoJSON Geometry is a valid Point or Polygon with the proper corresponding coordinates. The coordinate reference system for all GeoJSON coordinates is a geographic coordinate reference system, using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) [WGS84] datum, with longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees. Type must be “Feature” and must contain Properties with the operation information. A Polygon must be a valid closed polygon with no interior rings. Note: polygons may be clockwise or counterclockwise.


        Validations will be conducted when this method is called. If a field is not valid, or within the automatically approved altitude threshold, an exception will be thrown, and the auto authorization will not be saved.

      description: Call this end point to retrieve all the submissions that are

        not listed. By default, this endpoint lists 100 reference codes
        (active/open only) and their state, along with a “next_page_key”
        parameter. The list will be ordered according to the order in which the
        original operations submissions were received. The “next_page_key” is a
        key that should be used in the path of the following request to retrieve
        the next page results. Calls that include the “next_page_key” parameter
        will be limited to those results gathered in the original call to this
        endpoint – underlying data changes since the time of the original (page
        1) call will not be included in subsequent “next page” calls. If the
        original results are limited to a single page, the “next_page_key” is
        omitted.  Number of reference codes returned can be limited by using the
        “limit” parameter in the path, up to a max of 500.

      description: >-
        Call this end point to retrieve the operational statistics of operations
        between the datetime range passed and verify that the statistics match
        sufficiently – and thereby ensure proper operations on both sides.  


        How Operations are Filtered

        Operation start datetimes and operation end datetimes of authorizations, not authorization submission datetimes, are used to return the statistics for the defined time span in the call. If the duration of an operation touches the filter criteria, it is returned. The image below visually represents this concept. With time represented horizontally, each yellow highlighted bar represents an operation and its duration. The first vertical dashed line represents the filter start datetime and the second dash represents the filter end datetime. In the below examples, all the highlighted operations would be returned by the endpoint.

      summary: LAANC-signed Token Authentication
      description: >-
        Each call made to USS endpoints will include a LAANC generated and
        signed JWT.  The JWT will be included in the header under
        “Authorization” key. The LAANC system uses the type “FAALAANC”, for
        example:


        Authorization: FAALAANC <JWT>


        The JWT will contain 3 parts as defined in RFC 7519 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519), the header, payload, and signature.  The header contains the signing algorithm and a key ID.  The payload contains the token expiration timestamp.


        In order to verify the authenticity of each request, the USS application will use the LAANC public key matching the provided key ID (36-character UUID/GUID) to validate the signature.  The USS must retrieve the public key from the LAANC server; the key should be cached so that future JWTs referencing the same key ID may be validated without additional roundtrips to the LAANC system.  If the token has not expired and the signature is valid, then the request should be granted. If the input key ID is not found, a 404 response will be returned.
